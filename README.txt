A computer vision-based web bot to play an online game that I used to love as a kid, Sushi-Go-Round.

The code is modified slightly from Chris Kiehl's walkthrough of the implementation - https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-python-bot-that-can-play-web-games--active-11117.

The game can be found here: http://www.freearcade.com/SushiGoRound.flash/SushiGoRound.html
